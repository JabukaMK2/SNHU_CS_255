# System Analysis and Design

Included in this repository are two documents from projects completed in this class.  Please see the documents for examples of my work in this class.

This course put us in the role of a system analyst and designer.  The mock client was DriverPass, who we got to know through an interview with the client and representatives from our company.  The company saw an opportunity to create an application to assist people taking the driving test at the DMV.  They wished to provide practice tests in the form of written tests that would be updated with the DMV, and in person tests which would consist of a driving instructor who would pick you up from home.  The system was a web and cloud-based design.

In these designs I am quite proud of my diagrams, particularly my use case diagram included in the system design template.  I am very visual, so I find visual representations to describe the system design very useful.

If I was to revisit some of my documentation it would be the functional and non-functional requirements.  Additional rationale would have been effective to describe the requirements. Security was something I would address as well, like how the system would respond to brute-force attacks, user-level access design, and details on the training packages offered by DriverPass.

The usersâ€™ needs were partly implemented by the goals of DriverPass.  Ease of use is a major consideration of any system.  Users are likely to get frustrated if it is not so.  When approaching software design this is an important consideration of approach.  As I gain further experience, I get a better understanding of the questions I need to ask to get the answers I need for design.
